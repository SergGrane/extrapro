# Create a class called Rational for performing arithmetic with fractions. Write a program to test your class.
# Use integer variables to represent the private data of the class – the numerator and the denominator.
# Provide a init() method that enables an object of this class to be initialized when it’s declared.
# The init() should contain default parameter values in case no initializers are provided and should
# store the fraction in reduced form.
# For example, the fraction 2/4 would be stored in the object as 1 in the numerator and 2 in the denominator.
# Provide public methods that perform each of the following tasks:
# - printing Rational numbers in the form a/b, where a is the numerator and b is the denominator.
# - printing Rational numbers in floating-point format.
